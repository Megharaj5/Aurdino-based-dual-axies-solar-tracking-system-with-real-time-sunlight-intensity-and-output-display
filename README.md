# Aurdino-based-dual-axies-solar-tracking-system-with-real-time-sunlight-intensity-and-output-display
This major project focuses on the design and development of a practical engineering solution by applying core concepts of Electrical and Electronics Engineering The system is based on an Arduino Uno, which acts as the central controller for processing sensor inputs and executing control logic. Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) are used to continuously monitor sunlight intensity from multiple directions. Based on the variation in light intensity. To evaluate system performance, real-time electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and power output are measured using the INA219 current and power sensor. These values are displayed on an LCD interface, enabling continuous monitoring of the solar panel’s energy output.
